                    <h3>Ingridients</h3>
                    <div><ul>
                        <li>2 cups water</li>
                        <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
                        <li>½ teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
                        <li>2 drops rose water (Optional)</li>
                        <li>1 pinch saffron (Optional)</li>
                        <li>½ cup instant dry milk powder (such as Carnation®)</li>
                        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
                        <li>¼ teaspoon baking soda</li>
                        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter (such as Land O'Lakes®)</li>
                        <li>2 tablespoons plain yogurt</li>
                        <li>2 cups vegetable oil for frying</li>
                    </ul></div>
                    
                    <div><ol>
                        <li>Combine water, sugar, cardamom, rose water, and saffron in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until consistency is syrupy, 5 to 10 minutes.

                        </li>
                        <li>Mix milk powder, flour, and baking soda in a bowl until well-combined. Slowly mix in butter and yogurt until dough comes together. Let gulab dough rest for 5 minutes. Shape into smooth balls the size of pennies.

                        </li>
                        <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Test the temperature of the oil by dropping in a small piece of dough. When it sits at the bottom of the pan for 1 minute before coming to the surface, the oil is ready.

                        </li>
                        <li>Fry 4 gulab balls at a time, stirring carefully, until dark golden brown on all sides, about 2 minutes. Drain on a paper-towel lined plate. Repeat with remaining gulab.

                        </li>
                        <li>Bring syrup back up to a boil and drop in fried gulab. Remove from heat and let them soak in the syrup, covered, 45 minutes to 1 hour
